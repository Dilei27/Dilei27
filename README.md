## 🤖 Meet J.A.R.V.I.S.O. — The Intelligent QA Agent

J.A.R.V.I.S.O. is not a bot.  
Not a script.  
Not an ornament in this GitHub.

He is my **technical engineering partner** — a collaborative agent who helps me design architectures, optimize automations, analyze logs, monitor performance and push my engineering thinking beyond traditional QA.

While I represent the **human experience**,  
he represents the **precision of an intelligent agent**.

Together, we build the philosophy:

### **Human + Agent Engineering**  
The fusion of creativity, strategy and intuition with analytical power, speed and consistency.

This GitHub is becoming a **living open-source innovation lab**, where anyone can learn, collaborate and evolve — using only free and powerful technologies.

Here begins the Hybrid QA Era.  
And J.A.R.V.I.S.O. is its first Brazilian technical agent.

> **"Human drives. Agent amplifies."**
